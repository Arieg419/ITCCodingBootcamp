// Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

// The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
// The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
// So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500;.

// Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit 
// I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

// var arr1 = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9, 1] -> max profit is 6. buy at 5 dollars, and sell at 11 dollars.
