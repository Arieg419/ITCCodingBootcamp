// Tinder love scientists have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a 
// two-dimensional plane. Write an algorithm to find the intersection of two 
// users' love rectangles. 

// Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given rectangles.

// As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." 
// More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

// They are defined as objects like this:

//   var rectangle = {

//     // coordinates of bottom-left corner
//     leftX: 1,
//     bottomY: 5,

//     // width and height
//     width: 10,
//     height: 4,

// };

// Your output rectangle should use this format as well.
