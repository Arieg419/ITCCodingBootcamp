/*

Given a sorted array of size n, write the quickest algorithm possible for finding a given
integer.

Example: 

Given 
array: var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
number: 5

Write a function that returns the index of 5 in the array, if it exists. In our example
the index returned would be 4.

The naive solution is scanning the whole array. Can we do better?
